# [ISCAS 2022] SUNet: Swin Transformer with UNet for Image Denoising  

# modified 

## 1. Net
Changing the network to grayscale.

## 2. Added train_noise.py
Changed the training strategy as well as the way the program is trained. Instead of directly adding noisy images, we add different sizes of noise to the images in "train_noise.py" for training.

## 3. Added denoiser_SUNet.py
For matlab to load.

# suggestion
It is recommended to read the original version before reading that version, otherwise you can't understand it (QAQ). If you have questions or suggestions, Please contact chaochengma@163.com.

# Thanks
Finally, thanks to the author of SUNet for providing the network.
